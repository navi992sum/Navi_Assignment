assignment related with list and its method
deep copy, shallow copy, generating random numbers
======
follow these points , understand them , and execute , you will have good idea how the flow
works...

program to generate 20 random numbers say in the range of 200 to 300
and store it in a list 

Prog:: gen random numbers and store in list
import random as rd
lst = []
for j in range(20):
    rdn_num = rd.randint(200,300)
    lst.append(rdn_num)
# displaying them
for j in lst:
    print(j,end=", ")

Prog:: to generate float based random numbers
================================================
import random as rd
lst = []
for j in range(20):
    rdn_num = rd.uniform(200,300)
    lst.append(round(rdn_num,2))
# displaying them
for j in lst:
    print(j,end=", ")

Prog:: to generate random text of size as mentioned as in k=
explore these...

import random
import string

# Define the length of the string
length = 10

# Generate a random string
print(string.ascii_letters)
print(string.digits)
print(string.punctuation)
print()
for j in range(5):
    some_str = ''.join(random.choices("HelloBangalore123WelcomeMysore456", k=5))
    print(some_str)
      
for k in range(10):    
    random_string = ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation, k=length))
    print("\nRandom string:", random_string)

......
Assignment start here:-
1) input 10 numbers and store the numbers in TWO lists
   neg_lst  is the number inputted is -ive
   pos_lst is the number inputted is +ive
  find the total, avg of each list
  find the highest, lowest of each list

2) generate 20 random numbers in the range of 145 to 322
   store them in the list
   sort the list
   find the highest and lowest
   add the first five and last 3 elements - display the total
   
   ::tricky::
   iterate the list and delete all the elements between 165 to 222
   display the truncated list

3) foul_lang_word=["fword1","bad1","bad2","fword2","bad3","fword99","bad88"]
   given above are the bad words or foul words (given above , use it)
   input words till the user type "STOP"
   add the words in lst_word
   if the word is one of the bad words IGNORE it ; donot add
   sort  all the added words and display in sorted manner
   how many words were added ?

   make a deep copy of the NEW list created as new_deep_list
   make a shallow copy of the NEW list created as shallow_list

4) have TWO list 
   value_lst to which only int or float needs to be added
   str_lst   to which only str needs to be added 
   keep inputting the data  till user type "STOP" or "EXIT"
   when the user inputs which is always a str check whether it is int or float 
   RULE
      when the user inputs a number it will start from "#23" or "%567.22"
      then pick all after # and convert it to int
      if it is % then pick all after % convert to float
      otherwise it is str
      example               catg
      "#45"                 int
      "Deepak"              str
      "Amarnath PHd"        str 
      "%67.22"              float
      "%2.22"               float
      "#100"                int
      "address is 34/55"    str

     so on --- hope you got the hint
     find the sum, max,min, avg of all the contents in value_lst
